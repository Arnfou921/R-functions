Abstract--In this paper, we provide an approach to extract biomedical information related to breast cancer using text mining technology. We first extract entities related to breast cancer, then find these relationships, and visualize these biomedical information. Finally, these extracted biomedical information are annotated in the original experimental dataset which offer researchers as breast cancer biomedical information corpus. the approach provide an new way to obtain biomedical information of breast cancer. Moreover, it is promising for development of biomedical text mining.

I. INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is very common and highly fatal in women and may lead to death. Almost 7% of breast cancers are diagnosed among women age 40 years and younger in Western populations[1].It has received great attention from the research community. Researchers from various domains are still working hard to discover treatment which leads to guaranteed cure from breast cancer. With the vast amount of scientific publications on breast cancer, the text mining technology make the daunting task be possible. Text mining concentrate on solving a specific problem in a specific domain using natural language processing (NLP) techniques which attempts to understand the meaning of text as a whole[2]. It is typically comprised of the following stages: (1) Information Retrieval (IR), (2) Named Entity Recognition (NER), (3) Information Extraction (IE)[3]. Information retrieval is to gather the papers which are relevant to the topic of interest by Boolean model

and vector model. The best known one is PubMed, which searches the Medline database. There are other some IR systems, for example, PubMed Central(UKPMC)[4], which retrieves full-text documents from PubMed , PolySearch[5], which retrieves information including documents and database entries according to particular patterns of queries . NER is to find the biomedical entities that are mentioned within the gathered texts, for instance, the names of genes and proteins. Typical NER system includes ABNER[6] which could identify six categories entities based on conditional random fields (CRF)[7]. GARSCORE[8] could identify gene and protein names in text based on statistical model with an F-score of 82.5% for partial matches in test dataset. Information extraction aims to extract relationships among the named entities including two approaches: co-occurrence processing and natural language processing (NLP). iHOP [9] could process MEDLINE abstracts and generate a hyperlinked set of data for protein interactions with interactive functionality. Recent developments in molecular biomedicine and knowledge discovery have introduced new avenues for exploring the breast cancer. In this work[10], the researchers detected CyclinD1 expression using immunohistochemistry and CCND1 gene copy number in 355 invasive breast cancers. This study indicated loss expression of CyclinD1 might be an important event in the tumorigenesis in basal-like breast cancer. Moreover, they confirmed there are intense relationship between CyclinD1 protein and CCND1 gene in breast cancer. Fauteux[11] applied computational methods to select candidtate target overexpressed in three major breast cancer subtypes. Their results indicate that mining human gene

expression data has the power to select and prioritize breast cancer antiboby-drug conjugate targets. The work[12] indicate the clinical relevance of CXCL13 to young breast cancer as a potential therapeutic target for young breast cancer. New genetic biomarks could be find in the existing literature.
This paper presents a text mining approach to extract biomedical information for potential biomarkers related to breast cancer. The biomedical information include entities and

the relationships among them. The following sections describe the details.

Relationship extraction is to find the relationships between the biological entities mentioned in the text. There are two approaches to do this task: co-occurrence processing and natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we use the co-occurrence statistics to extract relationship among

In relationship extraction, we used co-occurrence statistics to extract entities' relationships by weights to measure the relevance considering two level's relationship: article and sentence. The one effect visualization of extracted relationships is shown in Figure 2.

The annotated results are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 using XML tags format. Figure 3 shows the annotated entities, and Figure 4 show the annotated relationship among entities. For example, Tag "<b class=\"protein"> ...</b> " annotated protein entities in annotated entity corpus. Tag "EA"

represents the entity could have the relationship of article level. Tag "ES" indicates the entity could have the relationship of sentence level. The number present the frequences of the level relationship.
In corpus annotation, we used extracted entity and relationship to annotate original experimental unstructured texts. using the Sentence class and the the annotated algorithm in the anotated corpus is shown in Figure 5.:

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed an approach to extract biomedical information related to breast cancer involving with biomedical entities, biomedical relationship. First, we extract biomedical entities based on CRFs, then in the base of identified entities, the relationships among their entities are obtained by co-occurrence statistics. Finally, these extracted entities and their relationships are annotated in original experimental dataset as annotated breast cancer corpus. The approach offer a new venue for obtaining biomedical information related breast cancer. Experimental results show the approach is promising for development of biomedical text mining.
