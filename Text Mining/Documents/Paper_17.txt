Abstract-- Discovering hidden patterns in medical data and relationship between them is often fallow. Classification technique in data mining is used to discover the hidden knowledge from enormous data.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

I. INTRODUCTION

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an

autoimmune, multi system disease which can affect any system of the human body including central nervous system which include cognitive and mood disorder, anxiety, depression and psychosis [8].

SLE will develop distinct immunologic

abnormalities

particularly

antinuclear,

antiphospolipid [6]. There are four main factors

involved in affecting lupus (i) genetic, (ii) hormonal, (iii) immunologic and (iv) environmental [4, 9]. This disease found difficult to diagnose and cannot be predicted with single parameter. It can be

identified with a combination of laboratory and clinical criteria [7]. American college of rheumatology established 11 clinical and laboratory

criteria among which 4 criteria must be satisfied to diagnose and treat SLE [10, 11].
The two primary goals of data mining is descriptive and prediction. Description is about

finding the patterns to describe data which can be interpreted by human whereas prediction involves fields or variables to predict future unknown values of other variables [5]. Predicting disease is vital role of data mining. Many disease like diabetes, lung

Sayed et.al., [1] designed a decision support system to predict heart disease using ID3 algorithm
& multilayer perceptron with back propagation as training algorithm. The work was done to predict the risk of heart attack. It covers the main objective to utilize the knowledge of previous history about the patient.
S. Vijayarani et.al., [2] surveyed about data mining techniques to predict the various type of diseases. These techniques are extremely applied for all the fields like health care, banking agriculture etc.,
Vikas chaurasia et.al., [3] used three popular data mining classification technique CART, ID3 & C4.5. The research shows the accuracy of ID3. Training and simulator error evaluation was also done. The model was implemented using WEKA tool.
Renu Saigal et.al., [4] shows that survival rate of SLE are approximately 80% in 10 years after diagnosis and approximately 65% in 20 years. A study conducted on Zimbabwe showed that renal involvement was common than photosensitivity and
serositis which was less common in United States. Based on the study the author concluded that the wide variation in the natural history of lupus is based on geographical groups and different ethnic.

The 3 stages of lupus are mild, moderate and severe.

III. PROBLEM SPECIFICATION
Prediction of the lupus disease needs a high data storage and good decision system, since the disease may affect any part of the body and which is not common to all patients. It needs a good and effective method to predict earlier. Thus this paper suggested a new methodology to predict and analyse the disease.
IV. PROPOSED WORK
The proposed work is to design a framework, to create an algorithm and the attributes which are involved in predicting the disease.
A. Proposed Framework
Fig 1 depicts the proposed framework which is divided into 3 phases.

classification, information gain is used. Entropy is used to measure the uncertainty which ranges from 0 to 1.

Lupus Care Specialist
Diagnosis
Patient Database

Phase I: Acquiring Data Set

Phase I: The first phase is acquiring phase which is acquiring the data from the lupus care specialist. The dataset about the existing lupus patient along with their complete history will be collected and in turn stored in database. Phase II: Data refinement phase is refining the necessary data from the database. This phase involves five steps (i) data pre processing: where the data will be processed, (ii) Data re-enactment: where the data will be further processed and the necessary data will be gathered. (iii) dataset classification: the data set is further classified based on plasma and serum blood count, (iv) access activity and severity: the disease is scored based on the WHO classification which shows how severe the disease affected the patient and (v) Monitor disease activity: which is to monitor how the disease is spreading to other parts of the body.
Phase III: Classification and prediction phase is where the ID3 algorithm is actually applied. The algorithm will be generated based on the SLEEDAI score, ACR diagnosis criteria. Finally the validation process will be carried out.

Fig. 1 Modern framework to predict Lupus disease

ID3 is a predictive model which was invented by Ross Quinlan in 1979. ID3 is used to build decision tree with information theory which was invented in 1948 [5]. It is a top down approach without backtracking. To select the best attribute for

Information gain used to measure the expected reduction in entropy. Initially ID3 calculates the gain of all attributes finally selects the one with the highest gain. The attribute with highest information gain will be located as root node in decision tree.

Step 1: Compute classification entropy Step 2: Calculate information gain for each attribute Step 3: Acquire attribute with highest information gain Step 4: Remove node attribute for further calculations Step 5: Loop 2-3 till attribute have been used Algo ID3(input attribute, output attribute, training data) {
If(training data = 0) {
Return (single node= failure); } If(records = positive) {
Return(single node = positive value); } If(records = negative) {
Return (single node = negative value); } If(input attribute = 0) {
Return(single node = most recent value);
} Else {
Calculate information gain for each attribute; Divide the attribute with highest information gain value; Return tree with root node A and arcs A1,A2...Am; Call algoID3 repeatedly till all attributes have been used; } }

C. Important attributes for SLE
Table I depicted the 9 important attributes to predict SLE disease. The table is divided into three columns, ID, attribute name and attribute domain values. Based on the data acquired, the decision tree will be generated. SLEDAI is disease Activity Index score which is used to show the severity of the disease which is shown in Table II. The decision tree shows the final prediction. 20 patients data has been given as input to the ID3 algorithm. Table III shows the analysis result and the clinical profile is shown in Table IV. Fig 2 shows the algorithm and Fig 3 shows the experimental result of the algorithm.

The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by computing the percentages of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The data set is divided into two parts. In one part 15 patient records are considered as training set and the rest is to test the performance
