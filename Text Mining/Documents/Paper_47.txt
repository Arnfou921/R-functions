I. INTRODUCTION
Finite fields and groups are widely used in the theory of logic functions and automata [1-3]. Particularly important role belongs to finite fields in coding theory [1]. In [4], it is shown that any finite automaton has an isomorphic image in the form of a linear automaton over some finite field. Analysis and synthesis of linear automata over an arbitrary finite field is carried out by traditional methods of spectral analysis.
Basic methods of spectral analysis [5,6] can be successfully used to check the possibility of discrete functions implementation by a neural element [13, 14] over a finite Galois field for finding invariant operations on them.
II. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF DISCRETE FUNCTIONS OVER A GALOIS FIELD
( )Let F = GF pm be a Galois field, which contains
the cyclic groups
Hk1 = a1 | a1k1 = 1, Hk2 = a2 | a2k2 = 1, ,
Hkn = an | ankn = 1 , Gn = Hk1  Hk2   Hkn
is a direct product of cyclic groups H ki . As a discrete function of n variables over the field F
we define the unambiguous mapping of the form f : Gn  F .
Note that the spectral analysis of discrete functions f : Gn  C over the field C is always possible because the field C contains a primitive k -th root of unity for

any k =HCK (k1, k2 ,, kn ) , ­ the least common multiple
of numbers k1, k2 ,, kn .
( )If to choose F to be the Galois field F = GF pm ,
the spectral analysis of a discrete functions f : Gn  F is not always possible [15, 16]. The spectral analysis of
( )discrete functions over F = GF pm will be possible
only when the dimension of the vector space
{ ( )}VFn = f | f : Gn  GF pm and the order of the
characters group X (Gn ) over the field F are the same. Consider the problem: whether it is possible to expand
a function f : Gn  F in terms of characters of the group Gn over the field F If k1 = k2 =  = kn = 2 and to choose F to be the field of real numbers R , the group
of characters X (Gn ) of the group Gn over the field R
coincides with the system of Walsh-Hadamard basic functions and the spectral analysis of discrete functions is possible.
If k1 = k2 =  = kn = k (k > 2) , and as a field F to
be choosen the field of complex numbers C , the group
of characters X (Gn ) over the field C coincides with the
system of Vilenkyna-Krestenson basic functions and the spectral analysis of discrete functions is also possible.
Let k = HCK (k1, k2 ,, kn ) . Let us show that in case
the field F = GF ( p m ) contains a primitive k -th root of
unity, k evenly divides u = pm -1 . Assume, that a field
with the primitive element  contains the primitive k -th
root of unity  . Then the cyclic group Hk =  |  k = 1
is a subgroup of the cyclic group of the field F and according to the Lagrange theorem [7], we obtain that k is a divisor of u . Let k evenly divides u . Consider the
element  =  u/k . Show that it is a primitive root of unity. Taking into account the properties of primitive element  of the field F [6,8.9], we can state that for any
i, j, r {1, 2,, k-1}  i  j , if i  j and  r  1 .
Thus, k is the least natural number so that  k = 1 . Hence, we conclude that the spectral analysis of the

discrete functions f : Gn  F is possible if and only if
k evenly divides u .

If k1 = k2 =  = kn = k (k > 2) , and as a field F to
choose the field of complex numbers C , the group of
characters X (Gn ) over the field C coincides with the
system of Vilenkyna-Krestenson basic functions and the spectral analysis of discrete functions is also possible.
Let k =HCK (k1, k2 ,, kn ) . Show that in case the field
F = GF ( pm ) contains a primitive k -th root of unity, k

evenly divides u = p m - 1 . Assume, that the field with
the primitive element  contains the primitive k -th root

of unity  . Then the cyclic group Hk =  |  k = 1 is a
subgroup of the cyclic group of the field F and according to the Lagrange theorem [7, 11], we obtain that k is a divisor of u . Let k evenly divides u . Consider
the element  =  u/k . Show that it is a primitive k -th root of unity. Taking into account the properties of the primitive element  of the field F [8,9], we can state
that for any i, j, r  {1,2,, k-1}  i  j , if i  j and

 r  1 . Thus, k is the least natural number so that  k = 1 . Hence, we conclude that the spectral analysis of discrete functions f : Gn  F is possible if and only if
k evenly divides u . Let us find an analytical form of characters of the
( )group Gn over the field F = GF pm . Let
k = HCK (k1, k2 ,, kn ),  be a primitive element of the
( )field F = GF pm , Hk = a | ak = 1 be a cyclic group

of the k -th order and k be a divisor of u . Then for an

arbitrary element hi  Hki there exists such

jki {0,1,, ki -1}

that

hi

=

a jki i

,

where

ai = ak /ki

is a

generator of the cyclic group Hki (i = 1, 2,, n) . The

characters  ri of the group H ki over the field

( )F = GF pm can be written as follows:

( )ri

hi

=

 ri i

jki

,

(1)

where  i =  u/ki , ri {0,1,, ki -1} .
Since the group Gn is a direct product of the cyclic groups H k1 ,, H kn , for an arbitrary g Gn there
exists such ji {0,1,, ki -1}, i = 1, 2,, n that
( ) ( )g = a1j1 ,, anjn = akj1/k1 ,, akjn /kn .

From the multiplicative properties of characters [5,6] and from (1) we have, that all characters of the group are functions

( )( ) r1,,rn

g=

,t1r1 j1 ++tnrn jn

(2)

where:



= u/k ,

ti

=

k, ki

ri {0,1,, ki -1},

i = 1, 2,, n

If on the set of all characters of the group Gn to define the product of two characters (r1,,rn ) , (q1,,qn ) as follows:

( ) ( ) ( )g  Gn

(r1,,rn )

g

 (q1,,qn )

g

= ( )r11 q1,,rn n qn

g,

where i is the addition modulo ki , they constitute a
multiplicative group of characters X (Gn ). On the basis
of (2) it can be stated that the number of different characters of the group Gn over the field F equals the order of the group Gn . Then the fact that the characters
are orthogonal [5,6] and X (Gn ) = dimF VFn = k1k2 kn
yields that X (Gn ) forms an orthogonal basis of the space
VFn . Thus, an arbitrary element f VFn can be written unambiguously:

k1 -1 kn -1

( )   ( )f

g

=

( ) s

r1 =0

rn =0 r1 ,rn

( )r1,,rn

g,

(3)

where the addition and the multiplication are performed

in the field F .

The expansion (3) is called the spectral expansion of

the discrete function f : Gn  F in terms of characters

of the group Gn over the field F .

Multiplying both terms of (3) by  -1

and adding

( )q1,,qn

up the left and right sides of the resulting equality for all

elements of the group Gn , we obtain:

 ( ) ( )f
gGn

g

 -1 ( )q1,,qn

g

 s

( ) ( )r1=0

Considering the orthogonality of the characters, the right side of the last equality can be written as:

 k1 -1 kn -1



   ( ) ( )gGn




r1 =0

Thus, the spectral coefficients of the function can be calculated according to the following formula:

where qi {0,1,, ki -1} ( i {1, 2,, n}) .
The aforesaid results of spectral analysis of discrete functions, functions of characters we shall illustrate by the following examples.
Example. Let n = 2, k = k1 = k2 = 2 and
( )F = GF 32 is a Galois field with the modular

polynomial x2 + x + 2 . Spectral analysis of the functions
f VF2 = { f | f : G2  F} (G2 = H2  H2 ) is possible,
because k divides u = 32 -1 . Denote  to be a
( )generator of the cyclic group of the field GF 32 , i.e.

( ) { }GF 32 \ {0} =  j j = 0,1,,7 . Then  =  4 = 2 .

The characters of the group G2 we calculate according to the formula (2)
( )TABLE 1. GROUP OF CHARACTERS X G2 OVER THE FIELD

Let f (1,1) = f (1, a) = f (a,1) =  and f (a, a) = 0 .

By the formula (4) we find spectral coefficients

s(0,0) , s(0,1) , s(1,0) , s(1,1) of the function

f

s(0,0) = G2 -1 ( 1+  1+  1+ 0 1) = 1 0 = 0,

s(0,1) = G2 -1 ( 1+   +  1+ 0  ) = 1 (2 +1) = 2,

s(1,0) = G2 -1 ( 1+  1+   + 0  ) = 1 (2 +1) = 2, s(1,1) = G2 -1 ( 1+   +   + 0  ) = 1 ( + 2) = 1.

Thus,
g G2 f (g) = 2(0,1) (g) + 2(1,0) (g) + (1,1) (g) .

III. INVARIANT OPERATIONS ON DISCRETE NEURAL
FUNCTIONS

Let k1, k2 ,, kn ,q be natural numbers

(ki  2, i = 1,, n, q  2)

and

k = HCK (k1, k2 ,, kn , q) . Further we consider only

( )those fields F = GF pm , which satisfy the condition:

pm -1 is evenly divisible by k . This means that the field

( )F = GF pm contains cyclic groups Hki , Hq with
corresponding generators

 i =  u/ki (i = 1, 2,, n) ,  =  u/q ,

where  is a primitive element of the field F , u = cardF -1 .

Define on the set F \ {0} a function Fsign as

follows:

  F \ {0} Fsign =  j , if

ju q



deg 

<

(

j

+ 1) u
q

,

( )where deg is the degree of   =  deg , .

j {0,1,, q -1}

( )A neural elements over the field F = GF pm is

called a logic unit with n +1 inputs x1,, xn ; x0 (n  1) ,
which respectively take values of sets Hki (i = 1,, n)
and H0 = { 1} , and the output, which takes the value of
the set Hq . Each input is assigned to a corresponding
element i of the field F and the values of the output signal are found as follows: the values of input signals are multiplied by the corresponding elements i , then the obtaines results are added up and at the output we have values Fsign by obtained sum.
Let Gn = Hk1  Hk2   Hkn be a direct product of cyclic groups Hki . A discrete function f : Gn  Hq is realized by one neural element over the field
( )F = GF pm , if there is such n +1 -dimensional vector

w = (1,,n ;0 )

(i  F ) that for all

114

g = (1,, n )  Gn f (g) =Fsign w (g) ,

where

w (g) = 11 + + n n + 0 , and the addition and the

multiplication are performed in the field F [12]. A

vector w = (1,,n ;0 ) is called a structure vector of

neural element (NE) on the field F .

A discrete function f : Gn  Hq , which is realised by

one NE over the field F is called a neural function over

F.

In the view of compact representation of classes of

neural functions over F , it is important to know those

transformations on discrete neural functions, that

maintain the feature of their implementation by one NE.

In the following theorems, there is obtained the

summarizing the results of [10], which mentions the

operations, concerning which the classes of many-valued

neural functions over F are closed.

Theorem 1. If the function f : Gn  Hq is realized
( )by one neural element over the field F = GF pm with
the structure vector w = (1,,i ,,n ;0 ) , then the
function f1 ( x1,,xi ,, xn ) = f ( x1,,i xi ,, xn ) ,
where i  H ki , is also realised by one NE over the field F with the structure vector
w1 = (1,,ii ,,n ;0 ) .

Theorem 2. If the discrete function f : Gn  Hq is
( )realised by one NE over the field F = GF pm with
( )structure vector w = 1,,i ,, j ,n ;0 and ( )ki = k j , then the function f2 x1,, xi ,, x j , xn = ( )= f x1,, x j ,, xi , xn is also realised by one NE
with the structure vector w2 = (1,, j ,,i ,n ;0 ) .

Theorem 3. If the discrete function f : Gn  Hq is

realized by one neural element over the field

( )F = GF pm

with the structure vector

w = (1,,n ;0 ) , then the function

f3 ( x1,, xn ) == ==  f (1x1,,n xn ) , where   H q ,

i  Hki (i = 1, 2,, n) , is also realised by one NE over
the field F with the structure vector
w3 = (  11,,  nn ;  0 ) .
The feasibility and the practical value of the development of methods of synthesis of neural elements and the study of invariant operations on boolean and multiple-valued logic functions over the Galois field are confirmed by the results of software experiments. The programs which simulate the action of multi-valued

neural elements and implement the spectral method for the synthesis of these elements over the Galois field indicate that the power of discrete classes neuro functions increases with increasing power of the Galois field. To confirm this fact, we give the following simple examples,
e.g. n = 2, k1 = k2 = q = 2  F = GF (3) . Number u is divided on k =  (k1, k2 , q) , therefore, the spectral analysis of Boolean functions over F is possible.  = 2
is the simple element of the field F. We will show all the Boolean functions of two variables in the following table shows that are implemented by one neuron element (NE) over the field F :
Table2. Boolean neuron functions over the field
GF(3)
11 1 1 1 2 2 2 12 1 1 2 2 2 1 21 1 2 1 2 1 2 22 1 2 2 2 1 1
Vector patterns of NE that implement these functions are the following:
w g0 = (0,0;1), w g1 = (1,0;0), w g2 = (0,1;0), , w g3 = (0,0;2) w g4 = (2,0;0) , w g5 = (0,2;0).
So neuro classes of Boolean functions of two variables over GF (3) consists of 6 functions g0 , g1, g2 , g3 , g4 , g5 .
Let's consider F = GF (5) field.  = 2 will be taken
5-1
as a primitive element of F field . Than  =  2 = 4 . Boolean neuron functions from 2 variables over GF (5)
will be illustrated in the following table: Table 3. Boolean neuron functions over the field

Vector patterns of NE will be the following:
w f0 = (0,0;1), w f1 = (2,2;2), w f2 = (2,3;2), w f3 = (1,0;0), w f4 = (3,2;2), w f5 = (0,1;0), w f6 = (1,1;4), w f7 = (2,2;3), w f8 = (3,3;2), w f9 = (4,4;1), w f10 = (0,4;0), w f11 = (2,3;3), w f12 = (4,0;0), w f13 = (3,2;3), w f14 = (3,3;3),
w f15 = (0,0;4).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Based on Table 3 we can claim that all Boolean functions of two variables are neuron functions over GF (5) field. The field GF (5) is a minimal Galois field
(field with the minimum number of elements), where all the boolean functions of two variables are implemented by a NE. It should be noted that over the fields of real and complex numbers, not all functions of algebra of logic from two variables are implemented by one neural element.
Let k =HCK (k1,, kn , q) (ki  2, q  2) and
Gn = H k1  H kn . Program experiments shows that there is used the following hypothesis :
Hypothesis. For the improvised k and improvised n the minimum Fmin Galois field can be specified
where all discrete functions f : Gn  H q are
implemented by one NE. This result is important for coding, compression and
transmission of information.
